# Alejandro Romero

Full Stack Web Developer  
Founder of **DeviENT**

Development is a process of making practical decisions.

Most issues in software projects come from weak structure and unclear boundaries, not from missing features. My focus is on building systems that are clear, modular, and able to adapt as requirements change.

DeviENT is the space where this approach is applied across different projects.

> Communication available in **English and Spanish**.
